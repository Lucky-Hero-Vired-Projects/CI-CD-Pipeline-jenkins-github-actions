## Project Overview
This project uses Jenkins to build a CI/CD pipeline that automates testing and deployment for a simple Flask application. The pipeline performs the following steps:
1. **Build** - Installs dependencies.
2. **Test** - Runs unit tests for the application.
3. **Deploy** - Deploys the application to a production server or local environment.

## Prerequisites
To run this pipeline, ensure you have the following:
- **Jenkins** installed and configured.
- **Python 3.8+** installed.
- **Git** installed for repository management.
- **Flask** installed as the application framework.
- A configured **Jenkins Job** with access to this repository.

## Pipeline Workflow
The pipeline consists of the following stages:
1. **Clone Repository** - Clones this GitHub repository.
2. **Install Dependencies** - Uses `pip` to install dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.
3. **Run Tests** - Executes unit tests to validate application integrity.
4. **Build and Deploy** - Deploys the Flask application on a target environment.
